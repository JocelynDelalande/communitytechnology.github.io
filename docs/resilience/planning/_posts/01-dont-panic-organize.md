## Introduction

What would you do if your neighborhood was hit by a major disaster? Do you and your neighbors have a plan?

The activity below is designed to introduce how to organize, plan, and work together to prepare. It is best done in a group of people - ideally you and other members of your community! You will role play as residents of a neighborhood with resources to offer and needs to meet. You should finish this activity with the skills and practical approaches to make your neighborhood more prepared and resilient.

This activity takes approximately one hour, so make sure to have enough time to fully explore it. It can accommodate over a dozen participants, as you can break into up to six or more groups.
