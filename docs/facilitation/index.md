##Facilitation for Community Technology

Community input and buy-in is one of the most important elements in practicing community technology. Neighborhood meet-ups or community meetings of any sort can be tricky to navigate with so many personalities and experiences at the table. Good facilitation is a key component to get the ball rolling and keeping people involved.

Facilitation is the art of creating a space where people can make connections and build powerful ideas. There are several participatory processes you can use to make collective decisions, design projects, and/or tap into the wealth of knowledge and experience that is present in the room. This document has a few examples of participatory processes that you can choose from to design an interactive community meeting.
