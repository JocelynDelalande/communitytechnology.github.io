## Choosing a Facilitator

Good facilitation is often hands-off, allowing participants to run the show. Facilitators should spend most of their time making sure people participate in the process and keeping participants on track with the purpose of the meeting. When choosing a facilitator, you want to find someone that can relate to your crowd. They should be able to: “read the room,” or catch visual cues that may signify tension. This might include encouraging people to speak who have not had the opportunity to do so because others are talking a lot. It takes the efforts of the whole group to create a space that feels safe for people to contribute their ideas. One of the most important qualities of a facilitator is good listening. The art of facilitation is in laying out information in a way that allows participants to draw connections.
