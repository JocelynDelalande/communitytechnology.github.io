**Zines** are small, self-published collections of stories, ideas and practices. They are often used to tell stories, ask big questions and explore different issues impacting the community.
Examples: [Detroit Digital Justice Coalition Zines](https://www.alliedmedia.org/ddjc/products), [(Re)Building Community Technology](http://communitytechnology.github.io/docs/blog/zine-v1/)
