##Shared Principles

Technology has been both a tool for positive social change and a tool for new or increased social conflict. Technology impacts the environment, jobs, government services, discrimination, local media, education systems, etc. In some cases these impacts have been positive, and in some cases these impacts have been negative.

These activities are designed for groups to think critically about the relationship between technology and social justice in their communities. There are many ways this topic could be explored, below are sample activities that can be modified depending on the group size, goals and time.

##Activity 1: Identify Digital Justice Issues

_From Virginia Eubanks, Popular Technology Workshops_

Often the words “problem” and “issue” are used interchangeably or sometimes a problem is mistaken as an issue. More importantly, not all issues offer the opportunity to work towards justice, dignity, equality and self-determination for all people. Choosing a DIGITAL JUSTICE ISSUE to work on early in the process will help your campaign or organization have a clear vision, build coalition with others, and avoid excluding important stakeholders.
 
**Time Required: 45 minutes**

**Materials:**

 - A place to take notes;  
 - Markers;  
 - Sticky dots

Read the difference between a problem, issue, and social justice 
issue below:
 
<table>
<tr><td>PROBLEM</td><td>ISSUE</td><td>DIGITAL JUSTICE ISSUE</td></tr>
<tr><td style="vertical-align:top;">
<em>Based on individual/personal issue</em><br/><br/>
Ex. I might lose my job because my duties can now be done by a machine.<br /><br/>
Ex. I can never get on the computers at the public library. 
</td>
<td style="vertical-align:top;">
<em>Based on a larger/community level </em><br /><br/>
Ex. Technological changes have made it possible for employers to move many of the community's jobs overseas.<br /><br/>
Ex. The community lacks low-cost or free public technology resources. 
</td>
<td style="vertical-align:top;">
<em>Based on larger/community issue influenced by historical or structural inequities </em><br /><br/>
Ex. Middle class/unionized jobs are being moved oversees, while service jobs (at below living wage) and high-level professional jobs remain here.<br /><br/>
Ex. The city government is investing in resources that serve creative professionals, and letting infrastructure in poor and working-class neighborhoods deteriorate
</td></tr>
 </table>

Each person should identify 3 digital justice issues in the community and write them down. Everyone should be able to finish in 5-10 minutes.

In the group, everyone should read their issues. Write down the digital justice issues on the wall.
 
Give each person three sticky dots. Using the dots, each person should vote on what three issues they feel most passionate about by putting the dot on that issue. Count up votes and identify top three.
 
Collectively, use the checklist below to help determine the strength and viability of each of those three digital justice issues as an opportunity for collective action.  

|Issue #1|Issue #2|Issue #3|Will the issue….|
|yes/no|yes/no|yes/no|Result in a real improvement in people’s lives?|
||||Give people a sense of their own power?|
||||Alter the relations of  power?|
||||Be winnable?|
||||Be widely felt?|
||||Be deeply felt?|
||||Build leadership?|
||||Provide community access or training opportunities?|
 
Put this chart in a place where everyone in the group can see it.

Based on these factors, what issue would you like to work on first? Why?  

##Activity 2: Identify Digital Justice Principles

**Goal:** Define a set of shared digital justice principles that can guide current and future work towards a healthier community.

**Estimated Time: 1 hour**

**Materials:**

1. Pieces of paper or Sticky Notes
2. Pencils or Pens

Having completed the previous activity, divide into groups of 3 or 4 people.

Complete the following sentence on sticky notes or pieces of paper. Brainstorm as many as you can in 10 minutes, writing one per piece of paper or notecard.


|Digital Justice in our community means _____________________.|


After brainstorming, combine similar ideas and narrow down the statements to what you agree are the 3 to 5 most important ideas to share with the group.

If you get stuck, the following questions might help you brainstorm:

- Is our digital environment fair and inclusive of everyone?
- In what ways has technology increased or decreased social justice problems?

Come back together as a large group to share your statements. What did the statements have in common?

##Other Activities: Storytelling Icebreaker

**Goal:** In this activity, participants will tell their stories about digital justice in their communities, using the Detroit Digital Justice Principles as a guide.

**Estimated Time: 30 minutes, depending on the size of the group.**

**Materials:**

1. Copies of the Detroit Digital Justice Principles for each person.

Share copies of the Detroit Digital Justice Principles with participants.

Individually, everyone should read the principles to themselves and think about a short story in their community that relates to a particular principle. Take 5 to 10 minutes to read and think about your story.

For example, the story could be about an event or time when you noticed an individual or group of people being excluded or misrepresented in the media. Or, you could talk about computer classes offered in the community.

Going around the room (or voluntarily), read the principle and share a story about that principle. The facilitator should let everyone know how much time each person has to speak.

##Other Activities: Talk about the Work

**Goal:** In this activity, the group will identify the work that is being done to build digital justice in the community and the work that needs to be done.

**Estimated Time: 1 hour**

**Materials:**

- Write each of the Detroit Digital Justice Principles on a separate sheet of paper.
- Pens

Break into small groups. Each small group should stand by a principle. 

Each group will spend 3 minutes with each principle and then rotate. Each groups will add information to each principle.

Under each principle, define the work that is currently being done in support of that principle. Think about the resources that currently exist in the community and the people that are already working on the issue.

Then, identify the work that remains to be done. 

What are the critical challenges? What could be changed to have a more just digital ecosystem in the community. What steps could be taken, either individually or as a group?
