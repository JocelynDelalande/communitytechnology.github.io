<section id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>When you plan a wireless network, you have to think about engineering specifics (how to create lines-of-sight for radio waves to travel) and at the same time about social dynamics (how to get neighbors working together).</p>

<p>This activity will help you use what you already know in your neighborhood, town, or city to design a wireless network that links the people and places you want to connect. It will also help you get familiar with the different types of routers you can use to build your network.</p>

<p><strong>Time required: 1-2 hours.</strong></p>

<p>In building networks, we want to shape the technology to fit our relationships rather than shape our relationships to fit the technology.</p>

<h2>Every Network Tells a Story Game Pieces</h2>

<p>Wireless networks are built with wireless routers. Routers can speak, listen or repeat.</p>

<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/files/cck/design_your_network_entas_support001.png" typeof="foaf:Image" width="510" /></p>

<p class="tip">Wireless networks are built using wireless routers. Meet the routers you will use for this game. Routers can speak, listen, and repeat. They all have direction and strength, meaning that they can broadcast and receive in different directions and at different distances. Broadcast strength varies a lot depending on environmental conditions.</p>

<section id="low-power-omnidirectional">
<h2>Low Power Omnidirectional (All Direction) Router</h2>

<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/files/cck/design_your_network_entas_support002.png" typeof="foaf:Image" width="510" /></p>

<p>Can broadcast and receive in all directions over a short distance</p>

<p><strong>Good for: </strong>Providing an access point for users, inside a house or building</p>

<p><strong>Estimated distance:</strong> 10-100 meters</p>
</section>

<section id="high-power-omnidirectional">
<h2>High Power Omnidirectional (All Direction) Router</h2>

<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/files/cck/design_your_network_entas_support003.png" typeof="foaf:Image" width="510" /></p>

<p>Can broadcast and receive in all directions over a medium distance</p>

<p><strong>Estimated distance:</strong> 10-300 meters</p>
</section>

<section id="high-power-sector">
<h2>High Power Sector (Directional) Router</h2>

<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/files/cck/design_your_network_entas_support004.png" typeof="foaf:Image" width="510" /></p>

<h2>Wireless Connection</h2>

<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/files/cck/design_your_network_entas_support006.png" typeof="foaf:Image" width="360" /></p>

<p>You can connect routers either with wires or wirelessly.</p>
</section>

<section id="rules">
<h2>Rules</h2>

<p>When designing your map, use the following guidelines for router placement:</p>

<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/files/cck/design_your_network_entas_support007a.png" typeof="foaf:Image" width="510" /></p>

<p>1. Any router can connect to any other router.</p>

<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/files/cck/design_your_network_entas_support007b.png" typeof="foaf:Image" width="510" /></p>

<p>2. Omnidirectional routers can connect to many routers in any direction.</p>

<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/files/cck/design_your_network_entas_support007c.png" typeof="foaf:Image" width="510" /></p>

<p>3. High power all direction routers can go further, but not as far as sector or focused routers.</p>

<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/files/cck/design_your_network_entas_support007d.png" typeof="foaf:Image" width="510" /></p>

<p>4. Low power all direction routers can connect to nearby devices.</p>

<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/files/cck/design_your_network_entas_support007e.png" typeof="foaf:Image" width="510" /></p>

<p>5. Focused routers can connect to one other focused router straight in front of it, even across a long distance.</p>

<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/files/cck/design_your_network_entas_support007f.png" typeof="foaf:Image" width="510" /></p>

<p>6. Sector routers can connect to multiple devices in the same general direction, across short or long distances based on the partner device.</p>

<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/files/cck/design_your_network_entas_support007g.png" typeof="foaf:Image" width="510" /></p>

<p>7. Two or more routers right next to each other (in the same building) can connect with a wire.</p>

<h2>Design Tips</h2>

<p>1. <strong>Line of sight:</strong> when connecting neighborhood nodes, line of sight is essential. Buildings, robust trees and other environmental features can obstruct wireless signals which can result in unreliable or nonfunctional connections.</p>

<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/files/cck/design_your_network_entas_support012.png" typeof="foaf:Image" width="510" /></p>

<p>2. <strong>Wireless Interference:</strong> if you have too many wireless signals within one area, they can interfere with each other.</p>

<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/files/cck/design_your_network_entas_support013.png" typeof="foaf:Image" width="510" /></p>

<p>3. <strong>Number of Hops:</strong> if routers are more than 2-3 wireless "hops" or links from another router, the connection may be very slow.</p>

<p>4. <strong>Users Connections</strong>: Laptops and smartphones cannot connect to routers that are far away. Outside, laptops and smartphones can reach routers that are 50m to 100m away, while inside the distance is much less. In your design, make sure there are smaller access points where you want people to be able to connect.

<section id="how-to-play">
<h2>How to Play the Game</h2>

<p>1. Your group should have 3-5 people who are familiar with the neighborhood. Gather your supplies.</p>

<p>2. Make a picture of your neighborhood. Either draw major landmarks and streets in your neighborhood on the large paper, or cut out elements from the "Design your Network: Construction Elements" module and glue them on. Everyone in the group should contribute.</p>

<p>3. As you are moving elements around to create your map, start to discuss what are the important places, organizations, public spaces or schools that you would like to connect.</p>

<p>Make sure to include:</p>

<p>"Community anchors" like religious institutions, schools, libraries, and recreation centers that are gathering-places in the neighborhood, and that may be able to share internet access.</p>

<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/files/cck/design_your_network_entas_support008.png" typeof="foaf:Image" width="510" /></p>

<p>Homes of people who are allies in the neighborhood, especially those who would be interested in donating roof or window space for the wireless project.</p>

<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/files/cck/design_your_network_entas_support009.png" style="width: 480px; height: 282px;" typeof="foaf:Image" /></p>

<p>Major features like rivers, highways, parks, bridges, etc.</p>

<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/files/cck/design_your_network_entas_support010.png" typeof="foaf:Image" width="510" /></p>

<p>Think about who in the neighborhood needs access and has access to Internet services. Where are they located with relation to each other?</p>

<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/files/cck/design_your_network_entas_support011.png" typeof="foaf:Image" width="510" /></p>

<p>4. Now draw your wireless connections with the markers. When you're drawing your links, think about social relationships that exist or could be built.</p>

<p>5. In the real world, every connection is a maybe. While sketching these maps is a collaborative planning exercise, it's important to remember the guidelines listed above.</p>

<p>6. Tell the Story of Your Network! Discuss with your group what you see in the map. If you're with other groups, you can present your networks to each other.</p>

<p><strong>Here are some questions to help you tell the story:</strong></p>

<p>What neighborhood issues could be addressed using a wireless network?</p>

<p>For example, does the network bring together two parts of a neighborhood that were separated by a river or a highway?</p>

<p>Does it connect the school to a park to a local organization, to strengthen the organizing network that already exists?</p>
