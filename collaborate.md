<h1>How to Contribute?</h1>

communitytechnology.github.io is housed in this <a href="https://github.com/communitytechnology/communitytechnology.github.io">GitHub repository</a>. We hope GitHub will be useful for collaboration, but it means that you will need a GitHub account to participate.

Once you have a Github account,  

+ suggest new content here: <a href="https://github.com/communitytechnology/communitytechnology.github.io/new/master">add a page</a>

+ make other suggestions here: <a href="https://github.com/communitytechnology/communitytechnology.github.io/issues/new">submit an issue</a>

+ or, edit a page using the edit (pencil) button from within the <a href="https://github.com/communitytechnology/communitytechnology.github.io">repository</a>

When you add or edit a page, you will need to click "Submit Pull Request" for your changes/additions to be considered.

We do not currently use the <a href="https://github.com/communitytechnology/communitytechnology.github.io/wiki">GitHub wiki</a> for communitytechnology.github.io, but you could also contribute ideas and content there.

Finally, some documents are being drafted in Google Docs, and you should be able to comment on those documents annonymously.
